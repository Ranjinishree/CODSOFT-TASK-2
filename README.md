The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset contains four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which serve as distinguishing factors for classification. The objective is to preprocess the data, explore patterns, and train models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to accurately categorize flowers into their respective species. The workflow involves data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, data preprocessing to normalize values, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
